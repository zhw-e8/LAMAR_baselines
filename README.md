# LAMAR_baselines
Baseline methods compared to LAMAR
We compared the performance of baseline methods with LAMAR for each downstream task.  

## Prediction of splice site
We compared with RNA-FM and SpliceAI in predicting splice sites of pre-mRNAs.

## Prediction of translation efficiency  
We compared with RNA-FM and UTR-LM in predicting mRNA translation efficiency based on 5' UTR.  

## Prediction of mRNA degradation rate  
We compared with RNA-FM in predicting mRNA degradation rate based on 3' UTR.  

## Prediction of internal ribosome entry site (IRES)  
We compared with RNA-FM in predicting internal ribosome entry site (IRES).
